## Running the Application(would not recommend yet)

Right now, this will not run because the database is hosted locally and not accessible to other machines. If you want to go through the hassle (I would NOT) to run the application, you must install PostreSQL locally, created the same database, and ensure that the credentials match the one in application.properties. After that, you would need to download the repository, cd to it and type the Maven-Springboot plugin command ("mvnw spring-boot:run" on Windows).
